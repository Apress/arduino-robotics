This is the github repo for all of the code in my new book "Arduino Robotics".

I am listing each piece of code in its own folder labeled by what chapter the code is from. There are 13 chapters in the book, though chapters 1-3 are informational and do not contain specific projects, so there will only be snippets of code in these folders (if applicable).

Feel free to download, use, and modify any the code listed here - but be advised that this code is intended to be used for educational, research, and testing purposes only.I do not warrant that this code will work for you, though I have throroughly tested it on my robots.

Chapter index:
